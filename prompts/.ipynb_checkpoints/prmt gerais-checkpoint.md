After implementing the suggested changes, something went wrong.
Please check the error in the attached image.



# Improve prompt

The prompt below, delimited by by triple quotes, will be submited to a LLM.
The LLM task will be to add new grouping to the transactions list in the React application.
Please improve the prompt so I can go on with the component improvement.

# 1. Project Overview

I am building a React application with Chakra UI v3 for managing financial transactions. The \
application interface includes a top navigation bar that allows users to switch between different views.

## 1.1 Navigation Bar Options

- **Transactions**  
  Displays a list of existing financial transactions.
  This view is fully implemented and must remain **unchanged**.

- **Tags**  
  Displays tags that can be associated with transactions.  
  This view is not implemented yet. It has a temporary UI in the file **'TagsPlaceholder.jsx'**.
  
---

# 2. Objective

Your task is to create the UI and logic related to Tags througout the user will be able to:

- Create, edit and delete tag groups - **TagGroup**.
- Within each existing TagGroup, create, edit and delete tags.

---

# 3. Database description

In this project, the database structure and behaviour are as follows: 

## 3.1. Transaction: a financial transaction identified by an unique ID. Each transaction may have multiple tags \
associated to it (from the same or different TagGroups). As attributes, it has the following fields:
    - id (PK)
    - date (Date, not nullable)
    - amount (Decimal, not nullable)
    - description (String/Text)
    - created_at (DateTime, not nullable)
    - updated_at (DateTime, not nullable)
    - tags (SQLAlchemy relationship for the many-to-many link, using the association table)

## 3.2. Tag: a tag, identified by an ID. Each tag belongs to one TagGroup, and may have multiple transactions \
associated to it. As attributes, it has the following fields:
    - id (PK)
    - name (String, not nullable, unique within a TagGroup)
    - color (String)
    - tag_group_id (FK referencing TagGroup.id, not nullable)
    - tag_group (SQLAlchemy relationship to the parent TagGroup)
    - transactions (SQLAlchemy relationship for the many-to-many link, using the association table)

## 3.3. TagGroup: each TagGroupg will have zero to multiple Tags. For example: the tags "Bus Fare", "Gas" \
and "Tool Fee" would belong to "Transportation" group. Another example is: the tags "Coffee", "Grocery" and \
"Lunch" would belong to "Food" group. As attributes, TagGroup will have following fields:
    - id (PK)
    - name (String, unique, not nullable)
    - tags (SQLAlchemy relationship back-reference to associated Tags)

## 3.4. Transaction/Tag association: this is a relationship between a transaction and a tag. Each \
transaction may have multiple tags (from the same or different tag groups) associated to it , and each \
tag may have multiple transactions associated to it.

## 3.5. Cascade Behavior: if a Tag is deleted, the corresponding entries in the transaction_tags association table \
should be deleted. If a TagGroup is deleted, its Tags must also be deleted.

## 3.6. The database structure and logic are defined in "models.py" and "routes.py", and should not be changed.

# 4. Code Provided

You will receive the relevant React component files, marked between triple backticks:
{files_presented}

---

# 5. Chakra UI Reference

Use Chakra UI v3 components and best practices for styling and layout. Refer to the official documentation:
{docs_presented}

---

# 5. Implementation Guidelines

- Use **4-space indentation** throughout.
- You are going to create only the Tags logic. The association between Tags and Transactions will be habdled afterwards.
- Maintain the **existing logic**â€”do not change how the current transactions UI works.
- Ensure the new "Tags" UI is simple and clearly marked as temporary.
- Follow **clean code** practices: prioritize readability, clarity, and maintainability.
- Ensure the design remains **visually consistent** with the current Chakra UI layout.

---

# 6. Deliverable

Update the code to reflect the new Tags management functionality. You may define new components if necessary, \
but keep the structure minimal and clean.
