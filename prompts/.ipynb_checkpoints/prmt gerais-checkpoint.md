After implementing the suggested changes, something went wrong.
Please check the error in the attached image.



# Improve prompt

The prompt below, delimited by by triple quotes, will be submited to a LLM.
The LLM task will be to add new grouping to the transactions list in the React application.
Please improve the prompt so I can go on with the component improvement.

"""
# 1. Context

I am building a React application using Chakra UI v3 to display and manage financial transactions. \
Each transaction is rendered inside a visual container (`Box`) and includes a `Checkbox` that allows \
the user to select **only one transaction at a time**. \
The selection logic is implemented using React Context to enforce single-selection behavior globally.

---

# 2. Objective

Enhance the layout of the transactions list by grouping the transactions by date. \
The transactions list should be organized as it is, but with the following differences:

- transactions should be organized in groups by transaction date.
- each group will have an header indicasting the group date.

---

# 3. Requirements

- Maintain the sorting data functionality as it is currently
- Maintain full compatibility with Chakra UI v3 and follow idiomatic React patterns (functional components, \
hooks, separation of concerns, etc.).
- The sorting control should be intuitive and visually consistent with the existing design.

---

# 4. Input Files

The relevant React component files are provided below (delimited by triple backticks):  
{files_presented}

---

# 5. Chakra UI v3 Documentation

Refer to the Chakra UI v3 documentation linked below for details on component usage and styling (e.g., `Checkbox`, `Flex`, `Button`, etc.):  
{docs_presented}

---

# 6. Expected Behavior

- Existing logic (including single-selection state and transaction rendering) should remain unaffected.
- The list of transactions should re-render correctly when the sort order is changed.
- Sorting should be efficient and not introduce unnecessary re-renders.

---

# 7. Additional Notes

- Preserve the current visual structure and styling.
- Use memoization or context selectors where appropriate to ensure optimal performance.
- Format the output with 4-space indentation.
- Keep the code clean, modular, and easy to read.
