## Navbar

I need to improve the prompt below to make it more specific and clear. It will be used to generate the Navbar component for a React application using Chakra UI v3:

Your task is to create a responsive navigation bar for a React application using Chakra UI v3. Make it simple and minimalistic.
The navigation bar should have the following items:
- Left side: Transactions, Categories;
- Right side: Sign Out button.




Your task is to generate desktop only `Navbar` component for a React application using Chakra UI version 3. The navbar should be simple and minimalistic, providing navigation for the application.

The navbar should have the following structure and behavior:

**Desktop View:**

* **Layout:** Items should be horizontally aligned. Use Chakra UI's `Flex` component for the main container.
* **Left Side:** Display the text links "Transactions" and "Categories". These should be visually distinct and potentially act as clickable links (though the actual link functionality is not the primary focus of this generation). Add some horizontal spacing between them (e.g., using `mx={2}` or `mr={4}`).
* **Right Side:** Display a "Sign Out" button. Use Chakra UI's `Button` component for this. Ensure there is sufficient spacing between the left-side items and the "Sign Out" button (e.g., using `Spacer`).

**Mobile View (Breakpoint: sm or below):**

* **Layout:** The navbar should adapt to smaller screens. Consider a simple approach like stacking the items vertically or collapsing the left-side items into a simple menu (though a basic stacking approach is preferred for this minimalistic requirement).
* **Left Side:** The "Transactions" and "Categories" text should either remain visible stacked or be represented by a simple menu icon (if you choose the menu approach). If stacked, ensure reasonable vertical spacing.
* **Right Side:** The "Sign Out" button should remain visible and positioned appropriately in the mobile layout (e.g., below the stacked links or next to the menu icon).

**Styling:**

* Keep the styling minimal. Use basic Chakra UI components for layout and spacing. You can suggest a subtle background color for the `Flex` container if desired (e.g., `bg="gray.100"`).
* The links and button should have clear and readable text.

**Output Requirements:**

* Generate a functional React component.
* Include all necessary imports from Chakra UI v3 (e.g., `Flex`, `Text`, `Button`, `Spacer`, `useMediaQuery`).
* Provide the complete React component code.

**Icons**

* When using icons use the react-icons library instead of Chakra UI icons.

**(Optional - Include if helpful):** You can also briefly show how this `Navbar` component could be used within a parent component.

Focus on a clean and straightforward implementation of this responsive navbar using Chakra UI v3's basic layout and component features.



The `Collapse` component was replaced with the Collapsible  in version 3. Please follow the documentation presented in the attached document. Review the code to make shure all used components are correct according to this new version.
