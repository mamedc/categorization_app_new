# Improve prompt

The prompt below, delimited by by triple quotes, will be submited to a LLM.
The LLM task will be to add new grouping to the transactions list in the React application.
Please improve the prompt so I can go on with the component improvement.

"""
# 1. Context

I am developing a React application for managing and classifying financial transactions.  
The project uses **Chakra UI v3** for the interface design.

The main layout includes a top navigation bar that allows users to switch between different views.
In the **Transactions** section, users can see a list of all transactions along with their associated tags. \
In the **Tags** section, users can see a list of all existing tag groups and it's respective tags.

Both sections include a **Actions Bar**, witch present the **Add**, **Edit** eand **Delete** options according to \
the selected object in the grid.

# 2. Task

Your task is to improve the **layout** of the React components presented below \
using **Chakra UI version 3**. The goal is to create a layout that is \
**clean, minimalistic and finantial-corporative style**, while preserving the existing structure \
and behavior of the app.

# 3. Reference Components

Use the current implementation of the provided components, enclosed between triple backtick, sas a base:

{files_presented}

# 4. Chakra UI v3 Documentation for LLMs

To ensure proper usage of Chakra UI v3 components and patterns, refer to the official \
documentation below:

{docs_presented}

# 5. Final considerations

- Use only **Chakra UI v3** components.
- Maintain consistent design and code structure.
- Follow clean code principles: clarity, simplicity, maintainability.
- Use **4-space indentation** for the code.
- Apply improvements to enhance **visual hierarchy**, **spacing**, **alignment**, and **responsiveness**.
