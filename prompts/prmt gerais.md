After implementing the suggested changes, something went wrong.

# Improve prompt

The prompt below, delimited by by triple quotes, will be submited to a LLM.
The LLM task will be to add new grouping to the transactions list in the React application.
Please improve the prompt so I can go on with the component improvement.

# 1. Project Overview

I am developing a React application using Chakra UI v3 for managing financial transactions.  
The application interface includes a top navigation bar for switching between different views.

## 1.1 Navigation Bar Options

- **Transactions**  
  Displays a list of financial transactions.  
  This view is already implemented and **must remain unchanged**.

- **Tags**  
  Displays tags that can be associated with transactions.  
  This view is already implemented and **must remain unchanged**.

## 1.2 Tags functionality

When navigating to **Tags**, the user will find all the existing **Tags Groups** and it's respectives tags. \
In selecting a Tag Group and cliching EDIT, a new modal dialog will open containing the options to edit \
all tags related to this Tag Group.

---

# 2. Objective

Your task is to implement the UI and logic for **adding a new tag** in the "Tags" modal dialog. \
Users should be able to:

- On clicking **Add** button, create a new tag for the Tag Group.
- Users must choose the new tag name and associated color.

---

# 3. Database Structure

The backend uses SQLAlchemy. You **must not modify** the structure or logic defined in `models.py` or `routes.py`.

### 3.1 `Transaction`
Represents a financial transaction. Each transaction may be linked to multiple tags (from any Tag Group).

- `id` (PK)  
- `date` (Date, required)  
- `amount` (Decimal, required)  
- `description` (String/Text)  
- `created_at` (DateTime, required)  
- `updated_at` (DateTime, required)  
- `tags`: many-to-many relationship with `Tag`

### 3.2 `Tag`
Each tag belongs to one `TagGroup` and may be linked to multiple transactions.

- `id` (PK)  
- `name` (String, required, unique within its `TagGroup`)  
- `color` (String)  
- `tag_group_id` (FK to `TagGroup.id`, required)  
- `tag_group`: relationship to the parent `TagGroup`  
- `transactions`: many-to-many relationship with `Transaction`

### 3.3 `TagGroup`
A logical grouping of tags (e.g., "Transportation", "Food").

- `id` (PK)  
- `name` (String, required, unique)  
- `tags`: back-reference to associated `Tag` entities

### 3.4 Many-to-Many Association: `Transaction` ↔ `Tag`
- A transaction can have multiple tags (from any group).
- A tag can be associated with multiple transactions.

### 3.5 Cascade Behavior
- Deleting a **Tag** removes its entries from the association table.
- Deleting a **TagGroup** deletes all of its

# 4. Code Provided

You will receive the relevant files enclosed between triple backticks:
{files_presented}

---

# 5. Chakra UI Guidelines

Use Chakra UI v3 components and follow the official documentation:  
{docs_presented}

---

# 6. Implementation Guidelines

- ✅ Implement only the new tag creation logic and it's association to the Tag Group it belongs to.
- ✅ Make changes only in the file "EditTagGroupModal.jsx"
- ✅ Do not modify the existing Transactions view.
- ✅ Follow Chakra UI best practices and maintain visual consistency across the app.
- ✅ Adhere to clean code principles: readability, clarity, maintainability.
- ✅ Use **4-space indentation** in all files.

---

# 7. Deliverables

Update the code to on "EditTagGroupModal.jsx" to implement the required functionality.  
You may create new components if needed but aim to keep the structure simple and maintainable.
