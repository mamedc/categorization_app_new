# Improve prompt

The prompt below, delimited by by triple quotes, will be submited to a LLM.
The LLM task will be to add new functioonality to the React application.
Please improve the prompt so I can go on with the component improvement.

"""
# 1. Context:

I am developing a React application using Chakra UI version 3 to display \
and edit financial transactions. Users must be able to select a single \
transaction at a time for edit or delete it. Each transaction is rendered within its \
own visual container (a `Box` component), and selection is managed via a `Checkbox` \
located within each transaction's display.\

# 2. Problem Statement:

The goal is to modify the provided React component(s) to ensure that when a transaction \
is selected, the correspondent edditing and deleting actions are enabled, and can be accessed \
via buttons located at the top of the transactions list.

# 3. Instructions:

Your task is to analyze the React component files provided below and implement \
the necessary changes to create the transaction action option . \

You **must** utilize the provided Chakra UI v3 components and follow React best practices.

# 4. Files to Evaluate (delimited by triple backticks):

{files_presented}

# 5. Chakra UI v3 Documentation:

Pay close attention to the Chakra UI v3 documentation provided below, especially regarding \
the `Checkbox` and potentially related components like `CheckboxGroup` (though single \
selection might necessitate a different approach). Ensure your solution leverages the \
appropriate Chakra UI features and styling.

{docs_presented}

# 6. Expected Outcome:

After your modifications, the React application should exhibit the following behavior:

* Clicking the `Checkbox` of an unselected transaction will enable actions buttons to be accessed \
to this specific transaction.

# 7. Considerations:

* Ensure the solution is efficient and avoids unnecessary re-renders.
* Maintain the existing structure and styling as much as possible, focusing on the actions section.
* The output must be formatted with 4-space indentation.
