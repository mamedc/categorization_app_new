# Improve prompt

The prompt below, delimited by by triple quotes, will be submited to a LLM.
The LLM task will be to add new grouping to the transactions list in the React application.
Please improve the prompt so I can go on with the component improvement.

"""
# 1. Overview

Iâ€™m developing a React application using Chakra UI v3 to manage financial transactions classification. \
On the top of the page, we have a navigation bar with two options:

## 1.1. Transactions

Displays the list of existing financial transactions. This UI is already completed, and should not be \
changed. 

## 1.2. Tags

Displays the tags that may me associated to the transactions. This UI isnot completed yet, and will be \
done in another oportunity. Therefore, in the current task, the user should be redirected to a temporary UI.

---

# 2. Objective

Refactor the provided code in order to the user to be able to select between the two navigation bar options. \
For each option, the user should be redirected to the corresponding screen as defined in item 1 above.

---

# 3. Supplied Code

Relevant component files are provided below (delimited by triple backticks):  
{files_presented}

---

# 4. Chakra UI Reference

Use Chakra UI v3 components and styling best practices. Documentation:  
{docs_presented}

---

# 5. Notes

- Format the code with 4-space indentation.
- Ensure clarity, readability, and alignment with best practices.
- Do **not** alter the current logic.
- Preserve the visual consistency with the existing design.
- Favor clarity and maintainability over excessive abstraction.
